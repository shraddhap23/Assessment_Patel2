// Create a function that initiates a countdown like you would use 
// when baking cookies or telling someone they have 1 minute to speak 
// on stage.  It takes in the number in seconds as its only argument 
// and counts down to zero! Start with displaying the seconds in the 
// console then try to get it to count down on your screen within an 
// html element. 
// If you have time to push this challenge further, style the 
// background to change based on how many seconds are left! 
// Note: Do not use the javascript setInterval() function.
